# Please note:

Location of the  **paeon**  library: https://github.com/peter88213/paeon
Location of the  **PyWriter**  library: https://github.com/peter88213/PyWriter

It is advised to clone these projects at the same directory level as the  *aeon2yw*  project and set a project reference to it. So the build scripts can generate the  *aeon2yw*  script.
